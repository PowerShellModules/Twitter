# BluebirdPS

## about_BluebirdPS

# Short Description

BluebirdPS is a Twitter automation client written for PowerShell 7 and above.

# Long Description

With BluebirdPS, you can publish a tweet, reply to a tweet, publish a direct message, upload media to use in tweets or direct messages, retweet/unretweet, like/unlike, add/delete saved searches, and retrieve many resources such as blocks, followers, timelines, and users. Additionally, you can retrieve lists, list membership, and list subscribers.

# DEVELOPER ACCOUNT TOKENS

Currently, any user of the module would need to apply for a Twitter Developer account at https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/user.html and create an application in the portal. Once you have created the application, generate your API key/secret and access token/secret. Then use the following command to add your key, token and secrets. Omit the `-Persist` if you do not want to save your credentials to disk.

### Example

Set-TwitterAuthentication -Persist

# HISTORY AND INFORMATION STREAM

The execution results of commands that connect to the Twitter API are collected in a module variable. The data contained in each record in the command history is the same that is written to the information stream. Some API calls, such as the append call within the Send-TwitterMedia command, may not added to history as there could hundreds of such calls when uploading large videos.

### History Note

THE COMMAND HISTORY DATA ONLY LIVES IN YOUR CURRENT SESSION AND IS NOT TRANSMITTED. If you re-import the module, the history will be reset.

### Example (Last 5 commands sent to Twitter)

Get-TwitterHistory -Last 5

# TWITTER API

While a few commands in this module are helper commands that don't connect to the Twitter API, the majority of commands do. For completeness of documentation, the developer has included definitions of the API endpoints that are currently supported. The command Get-TwitterApiEndpoint can help you discover "under the hood" aspects of each command. The definitions includes the API URL, which is also included in each commands LINKs section.

### Example

Get-TwitterApiEndpoint -Command Get-TwitterTimeline
