If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.\nThe order of user IDs or screen names may not match the order of users in the returned array.\nIf a requested user is unknown, suspended, or deleted, then that user will not be returned in the results list.\nIf none of your lookup criteria can be satisfied by returning a user object, a HTTP 404 will be thrown.\nYou are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.",
